# Probelem Statement
In this program firstly we ask for the number of employees who want to shedule meetings.Our loop runs for that time and each time we take 4 inputs from the user:
1. my_string = The time at which the request for scheduling a meet is made
2. start = The starting time of the meeting slot
3. duration = Duration of the meeting

Firstly we arrange the requests in ascending order as the request made first should be addressed first.

Then we start scheduling the meeting according to the chronological request of the requests made.Further if time overlapse it gives the respective msg.
